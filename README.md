# Priority-queueing-for-multi-phase-jobs
 use discrete event simulation to simulate a computer system
When you were learning about operational analysis earlier in the term, we talked about jobs that
require multiple visits to the CPU (or servers) to receive their service. In this project, you will
use simulation to study how priority queueing can be used to improve the performance of a multiserver system that works on jobs that require multiple visits to the servers.
In this project, you will learn:
1. To use discrete event simulation to simulate a computer system
2. To use simulation to solve a design problem
3. To use statistically sound methods to analyse simulation outputs
